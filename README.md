# In the tutorial folder are copy-righted files taken from the following url: http://ogldev.atspace.co.uk/
In order for this to work, download the full tutorial package from the link titled "Get the Source," at this url: http://ogldev.atspace.co.uk/ogldev-source.zip.  Also, the instructions link contains links to a video describing how to setup OpenGL stuff on macbooks; the video is at this url: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tz0dq2krCW8&list=PLRtjMdoYXLf6zUMDJVRZYV-6g6n62vet8&index=1
